Completely remove the "Remember Me" option from the WordPress Login form.

== Description ==

Completely remove the "Remember Me" option from the WordPress Login form. The "Remember Me" option is useful to keep you logged into your WordPress account on your personal computer.

However if it is used on a public or non-secure computer then, as it will leave an account logged in on the computer for 2 weeks, it can expose your site to unauthorised users.

The Remember Me Not plugin completely disables this functionality by resetting any attempts to set the "Remember Me" option, and completely removing the checkbox from the Login form (rather than just hiding it).

== Installation ==

1. Download and unzip the remembermenot plugin file and upload the directory to your wp-content/plugins directory or use the built in WordPress installer.
1. Go to the Plugins admin page and Activate the plugin, if you want the plugin activated network wide then network activate the plugin in the Network admin plugins page.
1. That's it - Remember Me is gone
